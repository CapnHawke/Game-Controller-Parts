## Summary



This board is a breakout board with a footprint for a Kailh CJP1311 analog Joystick. The board measures 35.5mm diameter. The footprint for the joystick is centered over the board. There is a set of five pads with 2.0mm pitch, with nets of VCC, Xout, Yout, Switch, and GND. Right angle JST PH connector is optional as an alternative to directly soldering wires. A pick and place file and a bill of materials is included if you want JLCPCB to solder a 5-pin JST PH connector on for you. 



Please note that as of August 13, 2025, this board is UNTESTED as I am still waiting for delivery of an order from JLCPCB.
